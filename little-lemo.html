          <h3>The Challenge</h3>
          <p>Nowadays, traveling with ride shares such as Uber and Lyft has been a straightforward and somewhat cheap option. Yet, it has not been very convenient for families who want to travel with infants or toddlers. Specifically, in Toronto/ Canada. For these types of situations, rideshares require families to bring the appropriate car seat for their children. And if you do not provide the car seat, the drivers are entitled to deny your request for the ride. However, some drivers might ignore the situation and give you a trip anyways.</p>

              <h5>Time Line</h5>
              <p>This was a 10-week project for a UX design course at Brainstation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="point">
              <h5>Team</h5>

            <div class="point">
              <h5>Key Goal</h5>
              <p>To create a ride-sharing app for families with infants and toddlers.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="project-detail">
            <h3>Research & User Empathy</h3>
            <h5>Problem Statement</h5>
            <p>Ordering rideshares for families with little kids is challenging. Parents have to deal with installing and uninstalling (let alone carrying) the car seat.</p>
            <h5>Competitive analysis</h5>
            <p>To figure out how to make this rideshare app different from similar apps, I did a competitive analysis to see how they are serving their users, how they measure success, and what opportunities they may be missing.</p>

            <h5>Wireframing Low/Medium</h5>
            <p>As I was wireframing the sketches, I realized that having tabs at the bottom of the app may not be the right solution and may confuse the users since the competitors have a different approach to their landing page. And confusing the users would result in frustration and losing their interest.</p>

            <h5>User Testing</h5>
            <p class="fw-bold">3 goals:</p>
            <p>1. Do users know how to add car seats to their requests?
              <br>
              2. Which features make them frustrated?
              <br>
              3. Do they understand how to communicate with the driver?
            </p>
            <p class="fw-bold">Participants:</p>
            <p>4 users, 3 of them had either infant or toddler</p>
            <p class="fw-bold">Format:</p>
            <p>Participants were given a scenario; they had to choose a recent address and add passengers and car seats (if they needed) to their request and chose a ride based on the given information.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="project-detail">
            <h5>Key Finding</h5>
            <p>- In response to the question of “how would choose a recent location,” 4/4 chose the right tab on the home page.<br>
            - I created “advanced tabs” for users who would continue using the app from their home to other places, so it decreases the stress of finding their recent place. 3/4 people used the tabs to chose the recent location.<br>
            - When they were asked to choose a car seat, 4/4 were able to locate the tabs at the bottom of the passenger info page.<br>
            I realized that similar apps usually have a white background with black texts, a clean design that leads to less frustration. So I decided to gather a mood board of those competitive apps to finalize the design of my app.</p>

            <h3>SOLUTION</h3>
            <h5>How to have a safe rideshare with your little ones?</h5>
            <p>LittleLimo is a ride-hailing app, which the user/passenger can submit a trip request along with the number/type of car seats. The app automatically sends the request to the LittleLimo drivers alerting them to the passenger’s location. The chosen driver will then come and pick them up and drive to the requested destination. What distinguishes LittleLimo from other ride-hailing apps is the added features that are specifically designed for passengers with infants/toddlers. There are more wait-time dedicated to passengers with infants/toddlers, given that they need it.</p>

          <div class="project-detail">
          <h3>What's Next?</h3>
          <p>I am going to focus more on the features that would be more beneficial for frequent users, aiming at riders who use LittleLimo at least two or three times per week. There can be subscription services for the users, priority urgency pickups, and more.</p>
